# Enthium — Engrammer meets Promethium

*Enthium* is a [highly performant] adaptation of the [Engrammer] and [Hands Down
Promethium] keyboard layouts.  It restores familiarity with [Arno's Engram 2.0]
layout (YOU on the left hand) and the [Dvorak] layout (HTNS on the right hand)
while optimizing punctuation placement for programming in the spirit of Engrammer,
featuring HJKL and `,;` for Vim, `-=` for zooming, and `./` for filesystem paths.

      q y o u = x l d w z
    b c i a e - k h t n s f
      ' , . ; / j m g p v
                r

## Rationale

* Same-finger bigrams (SFBs) such as UE (0.08%), WN (0.06%), and OA (0.05%) can
  be raked down vertically, reducing their impact on typing flow and performance.

* Pinky load is distributed by frequency: heavy letters B (1.44%) and F (2.14%)
  are close at hand on the home row's lateral pinky keys (CapsLock, Apostrophe);
  medium letters `'` (0.47%) and V (1.09%) are on the lower row pinky keys; and
  light letters Q (0.10%) and Z (0.09%) are on the upper row, which all together
  help reduce strain for short pinky fingers or those [weakened by convention].

* Apostrophe is away (on a different finger entirely) from YOU and I so that
  it can be typed without same-finger bigrams like You'd, I'd, He'd, They'd.

* Minus and equals are clustered for intuitive zooming in/out with Ctrl.

* Comma, period, and slash are arranged relatively to QWERTY for ease of
  adaptation, especially for navigation and custom application shortcuts.

* Comma and semicolon are associated for cycling f/F/t/T searches in Vim.

* Period and slash are associated for `./` `../` relative filesystem paths
  and easy access to forward slash and question mark for Vim text search.

* Apostrophe, comma, and period appear in the same sequence as in Dvorak.

* See [my blog post] for a deeper look into the design process of Enthium.

## Performance

The [keyboard layout community][rKL] commonly recommends [Pascal Getreuer's
guide][PGr] and ranking tables as a starting point for layout exploration,
and Enthium ranks among the top-performing layouts there as of 2025-09-13.

Comparing with [conventional layout rankings][PGl]:

* 0.07% LSBs — first 🥇 place; beats the entire table!
* 0.54% SFBs — second 🥈 place; only surpassed by Focal
* 1.49% redirects — first 🥇 place; beats the entire table!
* 0.16% scissors — fifth place; after Dvorak, APTv3, MTGAP, Colemak-DH
* 45.87% rolls — beats Semimak, Gallium, Engram, HandsDownNeu, Halmak, Dvorak
* 3.22% pinky off — beats APTv3, Semimak, MTGAP, Dvorak, Recurva, Halmak, Engram

Comparing with [thumb-letter layout rankings][PGt]:

* 0.07% LSBs — second 🥈 place; only surpassed by Caster
* 0.54% SFBs — second 🥈 place; only surpassed by Night
* 1.49% redirects — third 🥉 place; after Nordrassil, Vibranium
* 0.16% scissors — fourth place; after RSTHD, Promethium, Maltron
* 45.87% rolls — fifth place; beats Night, Promethium, Nordrassil
* 3.22% pinky off — fourth place; after RSTHD, Nordrassil, Night

Some SFBs in Enthium can be _raked_ vertically across adjacent rows,
allowing the same finger to slide over both keys in a single motion:

* 0.54% total SFBs - 0.29% rakeable SFBs = **0.25% _effective_ SFBs**
  - `ue` (0.08%)
  - `wn` (0.06%)
  - `oa` (0.05%)
  - `yi` (0.03%)
  - `a.` (0.02%)
  - `lk` (0.02%)
  - `e;` (0.01%)
  - `np` (0.01%)
  - `hm` (0.01%)

These results were [computed with Cyanophage's Layout Analyzer][cNM] as follows.
