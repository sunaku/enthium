# Enthium - Engrammer meets Hands Down Promethium

This adaptation of the [Engrammer] and [Hands Down Promethium] keyboard layouts
improves on the latter's performance in keyboard layout analyzers (see below)
by mirroring it horizontally to restore familiarity with [Arno's Engram 2.0]
layout (CIEA on left hand's home row; PF is swapped with WV to be like Engram)
and the [Dvorak] layout (HTNS on right hand's home row), and by optimizing the
placement of punctuation for programming in the spirit of the Engrammer layout.

Notably, the differences between Engram/mer and Enthium are so minimal that one
might switch to it completely with about 6 hours of practice, spread over 2-3
days (start Friday and use weekend), to unlock all letters in [KeyBr] training.

## Rationale

* Q and Z are split apart onto different hands for balance and symmetry.

* Apostrophe is away (on a different finger entirely) from YOU and I so
  it can be typed without same-finger bigrams such as `you'd` and `I'd`.

* Cluster minus and equals for intuitive zoom in/out shortcuts with Ctrl.
  Also put minus on index finger (just like comma, period, and semicolon) 
  for consistent responsibility of word/sentence delimiting punctuation.

* Cluster comma and semicolon for prev/next jumping in Vim for f/F/t/T.
  This also mirrors the relative ordering of H and L on the right hand.

* Stack comma and period for their shifted symbols `<>` to be raked down
  vertically, and cluster with minus and equals for `->` and `=>` arrows.

### Deviation: PF and WV

PF is swapped with WV in order to address the following inconveniences:

* WN is a stair-step ascension same-finger bigram that I wished I could rake down instead
* DW (2u skip) is not as convenient for Vim as it was in Engram (which puts them adjacent)
* FG (2u skip) is not as convenient for shell background jobs (`bg`, `fg`) as it was in Engram
* SW (half scissor) feels a little bit weaker curling inward than reaching up (as in Engram)
* FF (e.g. "stu*ff*") is a little bit of a chore for the pinky finger to tap twice in the upper row

I really didn't want to deviate from the canonical Hands Down Promethium layout
(this "Enthium" derivative was just supposed to be a simple horizontal mirror,
plus some rearranged punctuation marks) so I reluctantly went to the keyboard
layout analyzer playgrounds to see how bad it would be to swap PF with WV... and
to my complete surprise, this change hardly affected the layout's performance:

* Oxey's analyzer showed no changes at all in the stats!
* KeySolve analyzer showed an increase in FSB from 0.14% to 0.37% but the other
  stats improved: FSS reduced from 0.82% to 0.48%, HSB reduced from 6.05% to
  5.64%, and HSS reduced from 5.97% to 5.50%; everything else was identical.
* Cyanophage analyzer's Total Word Effort increased from 730.9 to 735.9 but all
  other stats remained the same!

I'm _so glad_ this experiment worked out because it makes the layout a lot more
comfortable for me in practice and it would also further reduce the barrier to
entry for others seeking to switch over to Enthium from the Engrammer layout. :)

### Deviation: B and V

B and V are rotated out from the upper row to the home row lateral in order to
avoid reaching up with short pinky fingers or those [weakened by convention](
https://reddit.com/r/KeyboardLayouts/comments/1fy8nve/_/lqulnww/ ).  Their keys
are reassigned to the least frequent letters in the English language: Q and Z.

In the Cyanophage analyzer, this change reduces Pinky/Ring Scissors from 0.49%
down to 0.35% (a massive drop!) and Skip Bigrams (2u) from 0.30% down to 0.29%.
The other analyzers don't fully comprehend the placement of lateral pinky keys,
as explained in the note at the top of each analyzer's respective subheading,
but Oxey's analyzer reports a notable reduction in SFBs from 0.829% to 0.818%.

The [keyboard layout community][rKL] commonly recommends [Pascal Getreuer's
guide and comparison table][PGt] as a starting point for layout exploration,
and you'll see that Enthium is among the best (statistically) layouts there:

* 0.811% SFBs -- wins 🥈 second place; surpassed by Focal
* 0.533% LSBs -- wins 🥈 second place; surpassed by Focal
* 45.283% rolls -- beats Nerps, Gallium, MTGAP, Graphite, Dvorak, Halmak, etc.
* 4.866% redirects -- beats MTGAP, Sturdy, Recurva, APTv3, Canary, Colemak, etc.
* 2.80% pinky off _excluding_ lateral -- beats Graphite, Canary, Gallium, MTGAP, etc.
  * `Q` (0.10%) + `'` (0.48%) + `Z` (0.10%) + `F` (2.12%)
* 5.35% pinky off _including_ lateral -- beats Engram, Halmak; surpassed by the rest
  * `Q` (0.10%) + `'` (0.48%) + `Z` (0.10%) + `F` (2.12%) + `B` (1.49%) + `V` (1.06%)

## Installation

### Linux setup

>*Legend:* QWERTY=white; Engram=gold; Enthium=blue/green; Quirks=pink.
>![Rendering of this layout on a row-staggered keyboard.](linux/layout.png)

Install:

    cd linux/
    sudo make install
    echo Now restart your graphical session.

Activate:

    setxkbmap -layout us    -variant enthium         # one layout; no switch
    setxkbmap -layout us,us -variant enthium,basic   # dual layout switching

Repair (e.g. whenever a system-wide XKB package upgrade reverts installation):

    cd linux/
    sudo make reinstall
    echo Now restart your graphical session.

Uninstall:

    cd linux/
    sudo make uninstall
    echo Now restart your graphical session.

### Windows setup

1. Install the official _Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator_ app: [MSKLC version 1.4](
  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134
).

2. Copy the `windows\kbd.h` file into your MSKLC installation folder located at:
   `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4\inc`

3. Launch the MSKLC application and load the `windows\enthium.klc` source file.

4. From the "Project" menu, select the "Build DLL and Setup Package" action.

5. Open the resulting build directory and run the `setup.exe` installer file.

See also [Remapping System Keys](https://msklc-guide.github.io/#3) in the MSKLC Guide.

### MacOS setup

#### Installation

In order to use the layout on MacOS, you'll need to install [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/).

You can install it via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

    brew install --cask karabiner-elements

Or download it from the main [Karabiner-Elements website](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/).

When downloaded, simply follow the instructions of the [installation guide](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/docs/getting-started/installation/).

#### Complex modification

Once everything is installed, you can use the [complex modification feature](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/docs/manual/configuration/configure-complex-modifications/) to remap your keys.

The enthium complex modification is available [here](https://ke-complex-modifications.pqrs.org/?q=enthium).

To get back to the basic layout, you can simply remove the enthium complex modification.

#### Uninstallation

* Brew : `brew uninstall --cask karabiner-elements`
* Manual : Remove the `Karabiner-Elements.app` from your Applications folder.
