# Enthium — Engrammer meets Promethium

*Enthium* is a [highly performant] [adaptation of] the [Engrammer] and [Hands Down
Promethium] keyboard layouts.  It restores familiarity with [Arno's Engram 2.0]
layout (CIEA on the left hand) and the [Dvorak] layout (HTNS on the right hand)
while optimizing punctuation placement for programming in the spirit of Engrammer,
featuring a `,;` cluster and HJKL for Vim, `-=` for zooming, and `./` for paths.

## Rationale

* The primary same-finger bigrams UE (0.08%), OA (0.05%), and YI (0.03%) can be
  raked down vertically, minimizing their impact on typing flow and performance.

* Pinky load is distributed by frequency: heavy letters W (1.77%) and F (2.14%)
  are close at hand on the home row's lateral pinky keys (CapsLock, Apostrophe);
  medium letters `'` (0.47%) and V (1.09%) are on the lower row pinky keys; and
  light letters Z (0.09%) and X (0.02%) are on the upper row, which all together
  help reduce strain for short pinky fingers or those [weakened by convention].

* Apostrophe is away (on a different finger entirely) from YOU and I so
  it can be typed without same-finger bigrams such as `you'd` and `I'd`.

* Minus and equals are clustered for intuitive zooming in/out with Ctrl.

* Comma and semicolon are clustered for cycling f/F/t/T searches in Vim
  and also to mirror the relative ordering of L and H on the right hand.

* Though period and comma are reversed in terms of their shifted symbols
  `>` and `<`, this arrangement helps to reduce lateral stretch bigrams
  while clustering `>` with minus and equals for `->` and `=>` arrows
  and stacking them vertically on traditional row-staggered keyboards.

## Performance

The [keyboard layout community][rKL] commonly recommends [Pascal Getreuer's
guide and comparison table][PGt] as a starting point for layout exploration,
and you'll see that Enthium is statistically among the best layouts there:

* 0.42% SFBs — wins 🥇 first place; beats the entire table!
* 0.22% _effective_ SFBs (excluding vertically rakeable ones):
  > UE (0.08%), OA (0.05%), YI (0.03%), A. (0.02%), HM (0.01%), NB (0.01%), DT (0.00%)
* 0.15% LSBs — wins 🥇 first place; beats the entire table!
* 0.08% scissors — wins 🥇 first place as a tie with Dvorak
* 46.53% rolls — beats MTGAP, Graphite, Gallium, HandsDownNeu, BEAKL19bis, Halmak
* 2.18% redirects — fourth place; surpassed by Gallium, BEAKL19bis, HandsDownNeu
* 3.31% pinky off — beats APTv3, Semimak, MTGAP, Dvorak, Recurva, Halmak, Engram

These results were [computed with Cyanophage's Layout Analyzer][cNM] as follows.
